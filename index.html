    <h1>Hummingbirds</h1>

    <p>A hummingbird must consume approximately 1/2 of its weight in sugar daily, and the average hummingbird feeds 5-8 times per hour. In addition to nectar, these birds also eat many small insects and spiders, and may also sip tree sap or juice from broken fruits.</p>
    <p>At rest, a hummingbird takes an average of 250 breaths per minute. Their breathing pace will increase when they are in flight.</p>
    <p>A hummingbird can lick 10-15 times per second while feeding.</p>
